  LongDescription: |2
    CoinUtils is an open-source collection of classes and helper functions
    that are generally useful to multiple COIN-OR projects.
    These utilities include:
     * classes for storing and manipulating sparse matrices and vectors,
     * performing matrix factorization,
     * parsing input files in standard formats, e.g. MPS,
     * building representations of mathematical programs,
     * performing simple presolve operations,
     * warm starting algorithms for mathematical programs,
     * comparing floating point numbers with a tolerance
     * classes for storing and manipulating conflict graphs, and
     * classes for searching and storing cliques and odd cycles in conflict graphs, among others.
